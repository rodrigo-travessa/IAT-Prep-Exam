# IatPrepExam
This application allows for users to register questions and then request quizzes with any number of questions, the application will then pick random questions from the database and give a multiple choice quizz, after answering the user can check the result screen and see how well he did, and how long it took to complete the quiz, and the average time for each question.
This application diferentiates users from administrators, only admins can delete questions, but anyone can add questions to the database, also only the user or an admin can delete the quizz history.
Since this was made with the purpose of helping a small group of friends, instead of large scale usage, the details/results of quizzes are not hidden from other users, but this would be trivial to change.
